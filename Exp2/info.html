  <h3>What Is AI?</h3>
  <p>
    Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.

  <h3>Pros&Cons OF AI:</h3>
<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <th>ADVANTAGES</th>
    <th>DIS-ADVANTAGES</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1) Reduction in Human Error:

      The phrase “human error” was born because humans make mistakes from time to time. Computers, however, do not make these mistakes if they are programmed properly. With Artificial intelligence, the decisions are taken from the previously gathered information applying a certain set of algorithms. So errors are reduced and the chance of reaching accuracy with a greater degree of precision is a possibility.
      
      Example: In Weather Forecasting using AI they have reduced the majority of human error.</td>
    <td>1) High Costs of Creation:

      As AI is updating every day the hardware and software need to get updated with time to meet the latest requirements. Machines need repairing and maintenance which need plenty of costs. It’ s creation requires huge costs as they are very complex machines.</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2) Available 24x7:

      An Average human will work for 4–6 hours a day excluding the breaks. Humans are built in such a way to get some time out for refreshing themselves and get ready for a new day of work and they even have weekly offed to stay intact with their work-life and personal life. But using AI we can make machines work 24x7 without any breaks and they don’t even get bored, unlike humans.
      
      Example: Educational Institutes and Helpline centers are getting many queries and issues which can be handled effectively using AI.</td>
    <td>2) Making Humans Lazy:

      AI is making humans lazy with its applications automating the majority of the work. Humans tend to get addicted to these inventions which can cause a problem to future generations</td>

  <h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
  <p>
    Natural language processing (NLP)[68] allows machines to read and understand human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of NLP include information retrieval, question answering and machine translation.[69]

    Symbolic AI used formal syntax to translate the deep structure of sentences into logic. This failed to produce useful applications, due to the intractability of logic[46] and the breadth of commonsense knowledge.[55] Modern statistical techniques include co-occurrence frequencies (how often one word appears near another), "Keyword spotting" (searching for a particular word to retrieve information), transformer-based deep learning (which finds patterns in text), and others.[70] They have achieved acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, and, by 2019, could generate coherent text

  <h3>Social intelligence</h3>
  <p>
    Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.[77] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction. However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.[78] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis), wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject

  <h3>Deep learning</h3>
  <p>
    Deep learning[124] uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.[125] Deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, image classification[126] and others.

Deep learning often uses convolutional neural networks for many or all of its layers. In a convolutional layer, each neuron receives input from only a restricted area of the previous layer called the neuron's receptive field. This can substantially reduce the number of weighted connections between neurons,[127] and creates a hierarchy similar to the organization of the animal visual cortex.[128]

In a recurrent neural network (RNN) the signal will propagate through a layer more than once;[129] thus, an RNN is an example of deep learning.[130] RNNs can be trained by gradient descent,[131] however long-term gradients which are back-propagated can "vanish" (that is, they can tend to zero) or "explode" (that is, they can tend to infinity), known as the vanishing gradient problem.[132] The long short term memory (LSTM) technique can prevent this in most cases.[133]
